# Quick Start Guide - AI Search Optimization App

## What This App Does

This app helps optimize your Shopify store for **AI search engines** (like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity) by structuring your existing product data in a format that AI bots can easily understand and reference. 

**Key Benefits:**
- Makes your products discoverable by AI search engines
- Structures existing titles, descriptions, and metadata for AI consumption
- Provides AI-enhanced features for advanced optimization (requires tokens)
- Generates AI-optimized sitemaps and structured data

**Important:** This app primarily **structures** your existing data rather than creating new content. AI-enhanced features are supplementary and require additional tokens (unless you're on Growth Extra or Enterprise plans).
